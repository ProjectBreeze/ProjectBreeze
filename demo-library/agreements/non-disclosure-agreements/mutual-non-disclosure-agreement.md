1. Each of the Parties under this document disclosing Confidential Information will be referred to as the "Disclosing Party", and each of the Parties under this document receiving Confidential Information will be referred to as the "Recipient".
2. The Parties wish to disclose to each other certain Confidential Information.  The Parties, intending to be legally bound in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises set forth in this document, agree:
	1. 	“Confidential Information” will mean all business information of a Disclosing Party that is disclosed or furnished to a Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of a Disclosing Party, whether in written, oral, electronic, Web site-based or other form, and includes any copies, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, notes, interpretations or other documents prepared by a Recipient which contain, otherwise reflect or are generated from such information. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, customer and vendor-related data, services/support information, and information about products, strategies and plans.
	2. The Recipient will hold Confidential Information in confidence with at least the same care Recipient uses for its own Confidential Information, and in no event, less than a reasonable standard of care.  Confidential Information will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating or undertaking a possible business relationship with or regarding the other Parties, and Recipient will limit disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, directors, officers, counsel, consultants, affiliates or contractors (the "Representatives") who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality arising to a level similar to this document and are notified that such information is Confidential Information and must be kept in confidence in accordance with this document.  Prior to disclosing Confidential Information to any consultant or contractor, Recipient will ensure that an executed non-disclosure agreement is in place with protections that are substantially similar to the protections in this document.  Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this document by its Representatives.
	3. The obligations of confidentiality under this document will not apply to any information that:
		1. was previously known to Recipient free of any obligation to keep it confidential;
		2. is or has become publicly known, through no wrongful act of any of the Parties;
		3. was received from a third party who the Recipient reasonably believes is under no obligation of confidence;
		4. was independently developed by Recipient without use of Confidential Information that has been disclosed pursuant to this document; or
		5. was required to be disclosed in order to comply with applicable law or regulation or with any requirement imposed by any governmental or court order but only to the extent required.

	4. Prior to making any disclosure under Section 2.3.5 above, Recipient will, to the extent legally permissible, immediately notify the Disclosing Party of the required disclosure upon receipt of a governmental or court order, and cooperate with the Disclosing Party in making a good faith effort to obtain a protective order or other appropriate determination against or limiting disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.
	5. The Recipient will notify the Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any breach of this document and will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized disclosure and use.  The Recipient will use its best efforts to enforce the confidentiality obligations of this document against its Representatives during and after the term of their engagement.
	6. No warranties are made and no responsibility or liability is or will be accepted by any Party in relation to or as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information or in relation to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information.  All Confidential Information is provided "as is".
	7. All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party.  The disclosure of Confidential Information will not constitute any grant to the Recipient, express or implied, of any rights to or under the Disclosing Party's patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or any other intellectual property rights.  Upon termination of this document, or at the Disclosing Party's request, all Confidential Information will be either returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed and certified in writing that such Confidential Information has been destroyed.  Recipient may only retain copies of Confidential Information to the extent that such retention is required by law and will retain only that portion which is legally required.  Notwithstanding the return, destruction or retention of the Confidential Information, Recipient will continue to be bound by the obligations set forth in this document.
	8. This document will continue for a period of two (2) years from the Effective Date.
	9.  The Parties acknowledge that the disclosure of a Disclosing Party's Confidential Information in violation of this document may cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm and that any breach or threatened breach of this document by the Recipient entitles the Disclosing Party to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to it, in any court of competent jurisdiction.
