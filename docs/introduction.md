# Project Breeze

## Introduction

Project Breeze allows you to read and write shorter legal documents that are just as robust and strong as the traditional approach.

The key concept is to store and reference a global and standard set of template language.

### How is this different from a
Unlike other document assembly tools or clause libraries, the centralized storage means you read it once, and it will remain the same no matter who the parties are in your next contract.

   1. The purpose of Project Breeze is to simplify legal documents by hosting reusable pieces of legal text (each called a "Package").  Users of Project Breeze may reference the standardized Packages available on the Project Breeze platform to be included right in their own documents.
   2. The key concept of Project Breeze is to allow the "Import" of Packages.  Though the act of Importing a Package is similar to referencing attached appendices with several key differences that are outlined in these Interpretive Guidelines.
   3. These Interpretive Guidelines will set out the rules for understanding and using Project Breeze.

## Getting Started
   1. Writing a Document
      1. Include a clause to introduce the Project Breeze Interpretive Guidelines.
      2. To Import a Project Breeze Package, a statement (called an "Import Statement") must be made beginning with the keyword Import and the statement must include at minimum:
         1. its own section/clause/chapter/article number; and
         2. a valid URL to a Project Breeze Package.
            1. A valid URL must point to either a specific version or to the latest version of a Project Breeze Package.
      3. The Import Statement may also include:
         1. A version number, which must also be accompanied by a version number in the URL
         2. A definition (Import ... as "NDA")
         3. References to or exclusions of specific enumerated clauses
            1. If the Import Statement includes or excludes specific references, only the selected clauses are Imported into the document and the rest of the Package is ignored and do not form part of the document.
         4. Field inputs
            1. Certain packages may include fillable fields with identifiers.  You should include inputs for each field.
      4. Packages that are Imported into a document are read inline as if they are subsections of the section of the document where they are Imported.  They are not attached to the beginning or end of the document akin to traditional appendices or schedules.  For clarity, an Import Statement in the contract are deemed to be substituted with the corresponding contents of the Package.
      5. Import with exceptions
         <!-- Amendments in terms of import, BUT do this -->
      6. Examples:
         <!-- Examples are missing -->
