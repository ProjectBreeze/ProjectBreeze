# Project Breeze

A framework for drafting shorter legal documents.

## Introduction

Project Breeze hides templated language away so you can focus on what really matters.  With a short tag in your document, you can reference our standard templates and dramatically reduce the size of your documents.

### Key Benefits

## Quick Start

### Reading a Document

### Writing a Document

1. Include a clause to introduce the Project Breeze Interpretive Guidelines.
2. To Import a Project Breeze Package, a statement (called an "Import Statement") must be made beginning with the keyword Import and the statement must include at minimum:
   1. its own section/clause/chapter/article number; and
   2. a valid URL to a Project Breeze Package.
      1. A valid URL must point to either a specific version or to the latest version of a Project Breeze Package.
3. The Import Statement may also include:
   1. A version number, which must also be accompanied by a version number in the URL
   2. A definition (Import ... as "NDA")
   3. References to or exclusions of specific enumerated clauses
      1. If the Import Statement includes or excludes specific references, only the selected clauses are Imported into the document and the rest of the Package is ignored and do not form part of the document.
   4. Field inputs
      1. Certain packages may include fillable fields with identifiers.  You should include inputs for each field.
4. Packages that are Imported into a document are read inline as if they are subsections of the section of the document where they are Imported.  They are not attached to the beginning or end of the document akin to traditional appendices or schedules.  For clarity, an Import Statement in the contract are deemed to be substituted with the corresponding contents of the Package.
5. Import with exceptions
   <!-- Amendments in terms of import, BUT do this -->
6. Examples:
   <!-- Examples are missing -->

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. Are Project Breeze documents legally enforceable?

Yes.  Legal documents are just as enforceable in any form of media so long as both parties understand and agree.  Today, legal documents already make heavy use of links to corporate websites, external policies, etc.  Project Breeze is no different.
