# Project Breeze

## Introduction

Project Breeze is a legal drafting framework to read and write shorter documents that are just as robust and strong as the traditional pen and paper approach.

The key concept is to rid uncontested template provisions in a legal document and to focus on what really matters.  Lawyers include those same provisions (such as "Interpretation", "Force Majeure", "Counterparts", etc) repeatedly with meaningless variations.  They are never in dispute and only serve to lengthen and complicate legal documents.

Project Breeze allows you to reference a standard set of templated language held by a neutral third party to your document.  Mirroring established programming frameworks, the process is to "import" a "package".  A single line (a package) may cut dozens of pages of excess text, but remain available should a legal issue arise.

### Key Features

* Cut out templated text
* Templated text stored by a neutral third party
* Use as much or as little as you want
* Customize to fit your needs

## Getting Started

### Reading a Document

### Writing a Document

1. Include a clause to introduce the Project Breeze Interpretive Guidelines.
2. To Import a Project Breeze Package, a statement (called an "Import Statement") must be made beginning with the keyword Import and the statement must include at minimum:
   1. its own section/clause/chapter/article number; and
   2. a valid URL to a Project Breeze Package.
      1. A valid URL must point to either a specific version or to the latest version of a Project Breeze Package.
3. The Import Statement may also include:
   1. A version number, which must also be accompanied by a version number in the URL
   2. A definition (Import ... as "NDA")
   3. References to or exclusions of specific enumerated clauses
      1. If the Import Statement includes or excludes specific references, only the selected clauses are Imported into the document and the rest of the Package is ignored and do not form part of the document.
   4. Field inputs
      1. Certain packages may include fillable fields with identifiers.  You should include inputs for each field.
4. Packages that are Imported into a document are read inline as if they are subsections of the section of the document where they are Imported.  They are not attached to the beginning or end of the document akin to traditional appendices or schedules.  For clarity, an Import Statement in the contract are deemed to be substituted with the corresponding contents of the Package.
5. Import with exceptions
   <!-- Amendments in terms of import, BUT do this -->
6. Examples:
   <!-- Examples are missing -->

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Are Project Breeze documents legally enforceable?

Yes.  Legal documents, though usually in writing, are just as enforceable in any form of media so long as both parties understand the content.  Today, legal documents already make heavy use to links to corporate websites, external privacy policies, etc.  Project Breeze is no different, it merely adds structure to the process.
